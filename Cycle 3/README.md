#### MySQL 5.7 or higher
#### A web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx)

## Usage
#### Clone the repository to your local machine or web server document root.
#### Import the sandwich_orders.sql file into your MySQL database to create the necessary tables.
#### Configure your database connection in connect.php with your database user, password, and database name.
#### Access the application through your web browser by navigating to the directory where the files are located.

## Future Work
#### Add the ability for Administrators to view, manage, and update the status of orders through the viewOrders.php page.
#### Implement user accounts to allow customers to save their favorite orders and view their order history.
#### Introduce payment integration to allow for online payments.
